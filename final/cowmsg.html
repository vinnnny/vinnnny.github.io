27% of the water footprint of humanity is related to the production of animal products. Only 4% of the water footprint of humanity relates to water use at home. Waste from animal production pollutes the ocean and kills marine life. The Gulf of Mexico dead zone is the largest ever measuring 8,776 sq miles in August 2017. The water footprint and pollution for the sake of meat is enormous.
